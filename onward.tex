\begin{abstract}
Test driven development (TDD) is a controversial and interesting approach to
software development; while many think of ``better tests'' as a
primary \emph{purpose} of TDD, in practice the goal is as much to use
tests to encourage continued progress in coding.   That goal however
rests on the notion that TDD ensures tests are good enough to let you
implement small new features and refactor code without undue fear of
mistakes.  Unfortunately, TDD is not ``self-enforcing'' and standard
TDD practice makes it easy to accidentally skip steps.  By integrating
a phase of focused mutation testing into TDD, however, developers
applying TDD can be sure they are not writing code that is not
supported by the scaffolding of tests.  The incremental nature of TDD
test and production code creation ensures that at no point will
``fixing up'' the mutants be likely to overwhelm the developer, and so
the final result will be tests with excellent code coverage and
mutation score, without a painful effort to ``patch up'' an inadequate
testing effort, and a TDD approach that includes automated checks that
the letter and spirit of TDD are truly being respected, and the
benefits of TDD presumably following in due course.

\section{Introduction}

The first question I should answer: given the abstract, which sounds
like a fairly standard research paper abstract, except for the part
about some experimental evaluation, why is this an Onward! Essay
and not a conventional research paper?

\subsection{What is Test Driven Development?}

Test Driven Development (henceforth TDD) has been defined many times,
in many ways.  Even if you're familliar with TDD, I would like to
revisit the foundations for a moment, because the proposal made here
is formulated with respect to a particular conception of TDD.  Most
definitions of TDD (including this one) properly present it as a
\emph{series of steps to be followed in development}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Think of a behavior your software does not yet have,
    but that you want it to have.
    \item Add a test that would pass if that behavior was present, but
      will not pass if it is not.
    \item Run all your tests and see that the newly added test fails.
    \item Make a \emph{small} change that makes the test pass.
    \item Run all the tests; make sure they all succeed now.
      \item Refactor to remove duplication/generally clean the code
        from step 4 up so it doesn't make you ashamed of yourself.
      \end{enumerate}

I added the first step, because you can't really write a test until
you've thought of something to test.
